// THE-JUDGE-AND-ITS-SUBJECT (2026-09-12): the judge names the SUBJECT it
// judges (subject.go) and evaluates only the predicates that subject admits.
// The applied-configuration predicate (a) and the coverage predicate (b) are
// statements about a directory; for an image subject they are NOT APPLICABLE
// and say so on the evidence line, and for a directory subject they read the
// subject's own tree, never the caller's.
//
// THE-SCANNER-THAT-SAYS-WHAT-IT-SAW (2026-09-16): predicate (b) is over what
// grype SAW. One scan writes two reports — the JSON report the verdict reads
// and the CycloneDX inventory of every component it catalogued, with the path
// of each — and no component may sit at a path git reports as ignored. A
// directory scan judged without its inventory is CANNOT-EVALUATE.
const defaultAllowlist = "grype-allowlist.json"

// run is main without the process: every path prints exactly one line to
// out and returns the exit code, so the driver is testable from fixtures.
